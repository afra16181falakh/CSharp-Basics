#  Basic C# Console App – User Interaction & Logic Demo

Welcome to my **basic C# console application** — a simple project to practice user input, string interpolation, methods, and conditional logic.

This app welcomes the user, takes input, performs a small calculation, and responds based on the input. Clean, minimal, and perfect for learning the C# basics!

---

##  What This Program Does

- Prompts the user to enter their **name**
- Asks for a **number input**
- Adds 10 to the input number using a method (`AddTen`)
- Uses `if-else` logic to comment if the number is big or small
- Waits for any key to exit

---

##  Sample Run
Welcome to My Basic C# App!

Enter your name: Afra
Enter a number: 42

Hello, Afra!
Your number plus 10 is: 52
That’s a small number!

Press any key to exit…

Concepts Used
	•	Console.ReadLine() for user input
	•	Convert.ToInt32() for type conversion
	•	Console.WriteLine() for output
	•	String interpolation with $""
	•	Basic conditional (if-else)
	•	A static method (AddTen) that returns a value
